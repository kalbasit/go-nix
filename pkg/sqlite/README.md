# Sqlite Packages

Each subpackage targets a specific version of an internal Nix [sqlite] database.

The user should only edit `schema.sql` and `query.sql`. All other files are generated by [sqlc] via `sqlc generate` from
the root of the repository.

> Note: when adding a new package, you must edit the `sqlc.yml` file at the root of the repository.
